## Introduction

In this vignette we will simulate two toy data sets and analyze them with GFA. The first toy data set is very simple and is the example shown in Figure 1 of the paper. The second toy data set is more complex. It includes more traits, a more complicated factor structure, and data are simulated with LD. For the second data set, we will compare results with and without accounting for correlation due to overlapping samples. 


## Simple Example

### Simulate simple data

We will start by constructing and plotting the true factor structure. GFA includes a convenience function `plot_factors` for plotting matrices as heatmaps. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(100)
# True factor structure
myF <- matrix(c(0, -1, 1, 1, 2, 1), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

myF <- apply(myF, 2, function(x){x/sqrt(sum(x^2))})

p <- plot_factors(myF, row_names = c("T3", "T2", "T1"), col_names = c("F1", "F2")) +
     scale_fill_gradient2(low = viridis(3)[1], high = viridis(3)[2], name = "Normalized\nEffect") +
     xlab("Mediator") +
     ggtitle("True Mediator Network") +
     scale_x_discrete(position = "top")+
     theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0),
           panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
           axis.ticks = element_blank())
p
```

Next we simulate some data using the `sim_lf` function in `GWASBrewer` which simulates from the GFA model,

$$
\hat{B} = LF^\top + \Theta + E
$$
$F$ is the factor structure, $L$ is the randomly generated matrix of variant-factor effects, $\Theta$ is an additional matrix of direct trait effects, and $E$ is measurement error. 

Our first example is a toy example designed to have a very strong signal that can be seen visually, but we don't consider these parameters realistic. We use three traits that each have a heritability of 0.5, GWAS sample size of $50,000$, and 80\% of trait heritability explained by the two factors. We generate 10k independent SNPs (no LD). $L$ and $\Theta$ both have 10% non-zero elements. There is no overlap between the GWAS samples.

```{r}
dat <- GWASBrewer::sim_lf(F_mat = myF, 
                          N = 50000, 
                          J = 10000, 
                          h2_trait = rep(0.5, 3),
                          omega = rep(0.8, 3), 
                          pi_L = rep(0.1,2), 
                          pi_theta = 0.1, 
                          est_s = TRUE)

```

For illustrative purposes, we plot some of the simulated effect estimates $\beta_hat$, selecting SNPS acting through a range of possible pathways with large effect sizes so that the pattern is clear visually.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
# Null SNPS which do not effect factors or have additional effects in theta
ix0 <- sample(which((rowSums(dat$L_mat_joint == 0) == 2) & (rowSums(dat$theta_joint == 0) == 3)), size = 8)
# SNPS which only effect trait 1 directly and not through factors
ix1 <- sample(which((rowSums(dat$L_mat_joint == 0) == 2) & (rowSums(dat$theta_joint == 0) == 2) & abs(dat$theta_joint[,1])> 0.02), size = 4)
# SNPS which only effect trait 2 directly and not through factors
ix2 <- sample(which((rowSums(dat$L_mat_joint == 0) == 2) & (rowSums(dat$theta_joint == 0) == 2) & abs(dat$theta_joint[,2])> 0.02), size = 5)
# SNPS which only effect trait 3 directly and not through factors
ix3 <- sample(which((rowSums(dat$L_mat_joint == 0) == 2) & (rowSums(dat$theta_joint == 0) == 2) & abs(dat$theta_joint[,3])> 0.02), size = 3)
# SNPS which only effect effect factor 1 
ix4 <- sample(which((rowSums(dat$L_mat_joint == 0) == 1) & abs(dat$L_mat_joint[,1]) > 0.07 & (rowSums(dat$theta_joint == 0) == 3)), size = 6)
# SNPS which only effect factor 2 
ix5 <- sample(which((rowSums(dat$L_mat_joint == 0) == 1) & abs(dat$L_mat_joint[,2]) > 0.07 & (rowSums(dat$theta_joint == 0) == 3)), size = 4)

X <- dat$beta_hat[c(ix0, ix1, ix2, ix3, ix4, ix5),][,c(3,2,1)]
se <- dat$s_estimate[c(ix0, ix1, ix2, ix3, ix4, ix5),][, c(3,2,1)]
plot_factors(X, col_names = c("T1", "T2", "T3")) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = viridis(3)[1], high = viridis(3)[2], name = "Beta hat") +
  xlab("Trait") +
  ylab("Variant") +
  ggtitle("Variant-Trait Associations") +
  scale_x_discrete(position = "top")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0),
           panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
           axis.ticks = element_blank())
```

### Fit GFA to simple data


In a typical GFA analysis of real data, the next step is to estimate the nuisance correlation matrix. In our toy example, there is no sample overlap, so we will skip this step, but we will include it in the next example.

To fit GFA to our toy data, we use the `gfa_fit` function. `gfa_fit` can take two types of input, either z-scores and sample size or effect estimates and standard errors. If you know the sample size for each GWAS, it is better to use z-scores and sample size. In either case, GFA will be fit using z-scores and the fitted factors will be re-scaled so that they are on the standardized trait scale. If z-scores are provided and no sample size is given, factors can still be estimated, but will be left on the z-score scale which depends on sample size and may not be interpretable. We will discuss scaling in greater detail later in this vignette.

```{r}
Z_hat = with(dat, beta_hat/s_estimate)
fit_toy <- gfa_fit(Z_hat = Z_hat, 
                   N = rep(50000, 3))
```

```{r}
names(fit_toy)
```

The resulting fit object  contains the following elements:

- `F_hat`: estimated factor structure on standardized trait scale
- `L_hat`: Estimated variant-factor effects
- `F_hat_single`: Subset of columns of `F_hat` corresponding to single-trait factors.
- `F_hat_multi`: Columns of `F_hat` corresponding to multi-trait factors.
- `F_hat_est`: estimated factors on the estimated (z-score) scale (usually not needed).
- `gfa_pve`: An object containing `genet_var` and `pve`. `genet_var` is the trait heritability 
explained by the fitted model. `pve` is the proportion of heritability for each trait (rows) explained by each factor (columns).
- `scale`, `method`, `params` and `fit` are for internal use.

We can plot the estimated factors using the `plot_factors` function:
```{r}
fit_toy$F_hat %>%
    plot_factors(., col_names = c("EF1", "EF2", "EF3")) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = viridis(3)[1], high = viridis(3)[2], name = "Normalized\nEffect") +
  xlab("Mediator") +
  ylab("Trait") +
  ggtitle("Estimated Mediator Network (GFA)") +
  scale_x_discrete(position = "top")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0),
           panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
           axis.ticks = element_blank())
```

The factors capture the truth quite well. Note that our estimated factors are in a different order than the original. It is important to keep in mind that the ordering of the factors is arbitrary. The sign of each column is also arbitrary.  We also have a third factor that effects (almost) only trait 2. This captures direct effects on trait 2 that are not mediated by the factors. For convenience, GFA will try to identify these single trait factors and separate them, dividing `F_hat` into `F_single` and `F_multi` as described above. GFA is not restricted to produce a number of factors equal to the number of traits. This occurs in this example by coincidence.

For comparison we can try svd applied to z-scores for the most significant variants which decomposes $\hat{Z}$ as $UDV^\top$ . Here the equivalent estimate to our factors estimate is $V$. Note that it is always best to run GFA on all variants or an LD-pruned subset and not on the most significant.

```{r}
maxz <- apply(abs(Z_hat), 1, max)
Z_hat_top <- Z_hat[maxz > 5.45,] ## corresponds to p < 5e-8

fit_svd <- svd(Z_hat_top)

fit_svd$v %>%
  plot_factors(., col_names = c("EF1", "EF2", "EF3")) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = viridis(3)[1], high = viridis(3)[2], name = "Normalized\nEffect") +
  xlab("Mediator") +
  ylab("Trait") +
  ggtitle("Estimated Mediator Network (SVD)") +
  scale_x_discrete(position = "top")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0),
           panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
           axis.ticks = element_blank())

```

The first SVD factor is a good estimate of true factor F2 but the subsequent columns do not correspond to true factors because they are constrained to be orthogonal to the first.


## More Complex Example

Next we will generate and analyze some more complicated data including LD and sample overlap. We use the LD pattern built into the `GWASBrewer` package which is estimated from chromosome 19 of the European subset of 1k Genomes.

```{r}
data("AF")
data("ld_mat_list")
length(ld_mat_list)
```

First we set up the simulation parameters. We will have 20 traits, 100k variants, and 5 unobserved factors. The GWAS sample size for the 20 traits will range between 30k and 50k with 30k samples common to GWAS of all traits. The proportion of non-zero effects are set so that, on average, there are 1k SNPs affecting each factor and 1k SNPs affecting each trait directly. 

```{r}
set.seed(201)
ntrait <- 20
nvar <- 100000
nfactor <- 5

# specify sample size matrix
Nmat <- matrix(30000, nrow = ntrait, ncol = ntrait)
Nunique <- ceiling(runif(n = 20, min = 0, max = 20000))
diag(Nmat) <- diag(Nmat) + Nunique

# proportion of effect variants
pi_L <- pi_theta <- 1000/nvar
```

Next we generate a factor structure. To do this we use the `generate_random_F` function in `GWASBrewer`. This function requires a sampling function for drawing factor-trait effects, the number of traits affected by each factor, the total trait heritability, the proportion of heritability of each trait explained by factors, and the heritability of the factors. For this example, we will generate factor structures until we find one where every trait is affected by at least one factor. 
            
```{r}    
# sampling function
g_F <- function(n){runif(n, -1, 1)}
# number of traits affected by each factor
nz_factor <- pmin(rpois(nfactor, 5)+1, ntrait)
# heritability of each trait
h2_trait <- runif(n=ntrait, 0.05, 0.3)
# proportion of trait variance explained by factors
omega <- runif(n=ntrait, 0.5, 1)
# heritability of each factor
h2_factor <- runif(n=nfactor, 0.5, 1)
done <- FALSE
while(!done){
  #cat("going..")
  myF <- generate_random_F(K = nfactor, M = ntrait, g_F = g_F, 
                         nz_factor = nz_factor, omega = omega, 
                         h2_trait = h2_trait)
  x <- rowSums(myF^2)
  if(all(x > 0)) done <- TRUE
}
```


Since GWAS samples overlap, the environmental correlation of the traits will affect the final GWAS estimates. Since each of our factors has some environmental component, some of the trait environmental correlation is mediated by factors. We can specify the correlation of the environmental components of the traits is not mediated by the factors. For our example, we will use a block correlation structure.
```{r}
Rblock <- matrix(0.5, 4, 4)
diag(Rblock) <- 1
R_E <- kronecker(diag(5), Rblock)
```

Now we are ready to generate data.

```{r}
dat2 <-  sim_lf(F_mat = myF, N=Nmat, J=nvar, h2_trait = h2_trait,
            omega = omega, h2_factor = h2_factor,
            pi_L = rep(pi_L, nfactor), pi_theta = pi_theta,
            R_E = R_E, 
            R_LD = ld_mat_list, af = AF, 
            est_s = TRUE) 
dat2 <- GWASBrewer:::calc_ld_scores(dat2, ld_mat_list)
```
We can take a look at the generated true factor structure.

```{r}
p <- dat2$F_mat %>%
	GFA:::norm_cols() %>%
	with(., A) %>%
  plot_factors(.) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = viridis(3)[1], high = viridis(3)[2], name = "Normalized\nEffect") +
  xlab("Mediator") +
  ylab("Trait") +
  #ggtitle("Mediator Network") +
  #scale_x_discrete(position = "top")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0),
           panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
           axis.ticks = element_blank(), 
	axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
	title = element_text(size = 20),
        legend.position = "none")
p
```

The simulated data also contains some objects describing the trait covariance. The traits are scaled to have a total variance of 1. `dat$Sigma_G` gives the genetic variance-covariance matrix, so the diagonal of this matrix gives the heritability. `dat$Sigma_E` gives the environmental variance-covariance matrix, so the total trait correlation is `dat$Sigma_E + dat$Sigma_G`. Useful for our purposes, `dat$R` gives the residual correlation of the effect estimates which is equal to `dat$trait_cor` with elements scaled by the proportion of overlap between GWAS.


### Estimate Nuisance Correlation

Since we have sample overlap, we should estimate the residual correlation. We can do this using either `R_ldsc` or `R_pt` to use the LD-score regression or p-value thresholding methods. For the LD-score regression method, we need to provide LD scores which were computed by `GWASBrewer`. 

```{r}
Z_hat <- with(dat2, beta_hat/s_estimate)
ldscores <- dat2$snp_info$l2
R1 <- R_ldsc(Z_hat, ldscores = ldscores, ld_size = nrow(Z_hat), N = diag(Nmat)) 
R2 <- with(dat2, R_pt(beta_hat, s_estimate, p_val_thresh = 0.05)) 
```

We can take a look at the estimated $R$ vs the true $R$. The LD-score method gives a more accurate estimate but takes longer to compute.

```{r}
plot_factors(dat2$R) + theme(axis.title =  element_blank()) + ggtitle("True R")
plot_factors(R1$Se) + theme(axis.title =  element_blank()) + ggtitle("Estimated R - LDSC")
plot_factors(R2) + theme(axis.title =  element_blank()) + ggtitle("Estimated R - p threshold")
plot(dat2$R, R2, xlab = "True Correlation", ylab = "Estimated Correlation - p threshold")
abline(0, 1)
plot(dat2$R, R1$Se, xlab = "True Correlation", ylab = "Estimated Correlation - LDSC")
abline(0, 1)
```

The LDSC estimate is closer to the truth, but GFA is not very sensitive to this difference.


### Fit GFA

To fit GFA,  we need to obtain an independent (LD-pruned) set of variants. We can use `GWASBrewer` to find this for the simulated data set. Note that we **should not** threshold on p-value. It is ok to prioritize variants by minimum p-value for LD pruning, but here we just prune randomly.

```{r}
ix <- sim_ld_prune(dat2, R_LD = ld_mat_list, r2_thresh = 0.01)
Z_hat_indep <- Z_hat[ix,]
dim(Z_hat_indep)
```

Finally, we can fit GFA with or without adjustment for sample overlap provided by the `R` argument. Recall that `R1` was estimated using LD-score regression and `R2` was estimated using p-value thresholding.

```{r}
fit0 <- gfa_fit(Z_hat  = Z_hat_indep, N = diag(Nmat))
fit1 <- gfa_fit(Z_hat = Z_hat_indep, N = diag(Nmat),  R = R1$Se)
fit2 <- gfa_fit(Z_hat = Z_hat_indep, N = diag(Nmat),  R = R2)
```

We can compare these results to fitting GFA using the true nuisance correlation matrix,

```{r}
fitoracle <- gfa_fit(Z_hat  = Z_hat_indep, N = diag(Nmat), R = dat2$R)
```

In this example, we get nearly identical results using either estimate of R or the truth. With any of these settings, we are able to accurately recover all five factors. We can see this by using the `min_norm` function which compares two factor matrices finding the rotation, $Q$ that minimized the frobenious norm $\vert \vert F_1 - Q F_2 \vert \vert_{F}$. The `min_norm` function will report which factors match between the matrices, how well they match, as well as the overall frobenious norm. A frobenious norm of 0 means the matrices are exactly the same. The value of the frobenious norm can be roughly interpreted as the number of factors in $F_2$ with no match in $F_1$ plus the number of factors in $F_1$ with no match in $F_2$, with partial scores for partially matching factors. 


For example, we can first compare the true factor structure to our first GFA estimate. This shows that all five factors were recovered with very high correlation. The value in the `val` column of the `solution` element is equal to the normalized inner product of the two factors, approximately equal to the correlation.

```{r}
min_norm(f_true = dat2$F_mat, f_hat = fit1$F_hat)
```

Looking at the frobenious norm values, we can see that all GFA estimates that included the nuisance correlation were very similar.
```{r}
min_norm(f_true = dat2$F_mat, f_hat = fit1$F_hat)$frob_n
min_norm(f_true = dat2$F_mat, f_hat = fit2$F_hat)$frob_n
min_norm(f_true = dat2$F_mat, f_hat = fitoracle$F_hat)$frob_n
```

If we compare these results with the results where we omitted the `R` argument, we can see that not adjusting for the nuisance correlation has resulted in four extra factors being estimated that don't match any true factors. The correlation between the matching factors is also slightly lower than in the result where we did account for sample overlap. The two factors given scores of NA are single trait factors and don't count towards the overall forbenious norm score. The value in `opt_frob_n` shows the best score achievable by selecting only a subset of the estimated factors. We can see that, even if we knew which factors to remove, we would still have a worse match than achieved by the method which accounts for sample overlap.

```{r}
min_norm(f_true = dat2$F_mat, f_hat = fit0$F_hat)
```

Plotting the factors estimated with and without the correction for overlapping samples, shows that the factor structure of the extra factors mimics the structure of the environmental correlation. We can also see that some of the matching factors estimated in `fit0` are contaminated with some of the structure of the environmental correlation. Here we plot only the multi-trait factors.
```{r}
p0 <- fit0$F_hat_multi %>% 
  plot_factors(.) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = viridis(3)[1], high = viridis(3)[2]) +
  xlab("Factor") +
  ylab("Trait") +
  ggtitle("Without Sample Overlap Correction") 

p1 <- fit1$F_hat_multi %>% 
  plot_factors(.) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = viridis(3)[1], high = viridis(3)[2]) +
  xlab("Factor") +
  ylab("Trait") +
  ggtitle("With Sample Overlap Correction") 
p0
p1
```

## Understanding Scaling Within and Between Factors

If data is supplied as z-scores and sample sizes, the effects in `F_hat` will be returned are on the standardized effect scale. For example, if the first column of `F_hat` was equal to $(1, 2, 0)$, this would mean that, for each unit increase in the first factor, there is a 1 sd increase in trait 1, a 2 sd increase in trait 2 and no change in trait 3. However the scale of the inferred factor is arbitrary, so a factor $(1, 2, 0)$ is equivalent to a factor $(0.1, 0.2, 0)$. This means that an appropriate interpretation of the factor $(1, 2, 0)$ is that the first factor has an effect on trait 2 that is twice as big as its effect on trait 1 **in units of trait standard deviations**. For plotting convenience, in our output, we always scale the factors so that the columns of `F_hat` have norm 1. 

If only z-scores and no sample sizes are provided, the effects in `F_hat` will be returned are on the z-score scale, proportional to trait standard deviation divided times square root of sample size. Since sample size is a study design parameter, these effects are not immediately interpretable, but could be converted to the standardized trait scale by dividing each row of `F_hat` by the square root of the sample size for the corresponding trait. 

If effect estimates and standard errors are supplied, the the effects in `F_hat` will be returned on the natural scale, i.e. the scale of the trait used in GWAS. Alternatively, if effects on the natural scale are desired, GFA can be fit using z-scores, and then effects can be transformed. Supplying data as z-scores and sample size or as effect estimates and standard errors should give nearly identical results up to trait scaling.

## Percent of Heritability Explained


The `gfa_pve` element of the GFA results object contains two elements, a vector, `genet_var` and a matrix `pve`. 
The `genet_var` vector gives the proportion of trait variance explained by the variants that GFA was fit with
according to the fitted model. This is an estimate of the heritability attributable to the variants in the model. 
In most cases, this is an underestimate of the total trait heritability
because GFA is only fit with an LD-pruned subset of variants. We don't recommend GFA as 
an ideal heritability estimation tool. The more interesting object is `pve` which has dimension traits by 
inferred factors and gives for each trait, the proportion of heritability explained by that factor. 
We have found that even though the model does not capture all of the total heritability, our estimates of
proportion of heritability explained by each factor are close to the truth. 

Using results from the second example, we plot the proportion of variance explained matrix:
```{r}
p1 <- fit1$gfa_pve$pve %>% 
  plot_factors(.) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = c("white", rev(viridis(3)))) +
  xlab("Factor") +
  ylab("Trait")
```

We can compare our estimated proportion of heritability
explained with the true heritability explained by each factor.
```{r}
sim_calc_pve <- function(dat){
  sj <- sapply(1:ncol(dat$F_mat), function(kk){
     compute_h2(b_joint = with(dat, L_mat_joint[,kk,drop = F] %*% t(F_mat[,kk, drop = F])), 
                geno_scale = "allele", 
                af = AF, 
                R_LD = ld_mat_list)
    }) |> matrix(nrow = nrow(dat$F_mat), byrow = FALSE)
  return(sj/dat$h2)
}
pve_true <- sim_calc_pve(dat2)

## order true pve and estimated pve so they can be compared
sol <- min_norm(f_hat = fit1$F_hat, 
                f_true = dat2$F_mat)$solution
order_true <- sol$true_ix
order_est <- sol$est_ix
pve_est <- fit1$gfa_pve$pve[, order_est]
pve_true <- pve_true[, order_true]
plot(pve_true, pve_est)
abline(0, 1)
```

In this example, our estimated proportions of heritability explained tend to be lower than the truth, but are generally fairly close.
